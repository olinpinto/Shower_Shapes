# Shower Shapes 

A three dimensional shower parametrisation to study the spatial development of electromagentic and hadronic showers using the CALICE highly granular scintillator-steel analogue hadronic calorimeter is developed. 

The longitudinal behaviour have been parametrised with a sum of two contributions (gamma distributions) called “short” and “long”. The imporoved radial profiles have been parametrised with the sum of three exponential functions the Electromagentic Core which describe the behaviour near the shower axis and the Hadronic component consisting hadronic “core” region and at the shower periphery “halo” region. 

This file includes the fit functions and a brief implementation of Chi2-Minimization procedures for simultaneous fits.
